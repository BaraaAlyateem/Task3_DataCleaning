# Data Cleaning Task  

## Overview  
This project focuses on **data cleaning and preprocessing**, which are essential first steps in any data science workflow. The task was part of my summer training program and aimed to transform raw, messy datasets into structured and reliable data suitable for analysis and machine learning modeling.  

## Features  
- Imported and explored raw datasets using **Pandas and Numpy**.  
- Identified and handled missing values with techniques such as:  
  - Placeholder filling  
  - Mean/Mode imputation  
  - Dropping irrelevant rows/columns  
- Removed duplicates and standardized inconsistent data formats.  
- Generated a cleaned dataset ready for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and modeling as if to present to a CEO of a company.  
- Documented insights and steps clearly for reproducibility.
